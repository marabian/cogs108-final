## cogs108-final
Final project for COGS108 (Spring 2020), taken at University of California, San Diego.

### Overview
The goal of this project is to use a dataset provided by Yelp, which contains information on restaurant ratings, review counts, ZIP codes, and average price, to predict a given restaurant's Yelp score. The predicted yelp score will be determined using the previous factors, specifically the positive reviews, the greater amount of review counts, all with using the location of the restaurant with the zip codes provided in the data set.

### How to replicate
To run locally, install dependencies using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your python environment, then in project directory run the command `jupyter notebook` to launch the Jupyter notebook file on localhost.
