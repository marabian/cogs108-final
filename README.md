## cogs108-final
Final project for COGS108 - Data Science in Practice (Spring 2020), taken at University of California, San Diego. Projected was completed in the span of one day.

### Overview
The goal of this project is to use a dataset provided by Yelp, which contains information on restaurant ratings, review counts, ZIP codes, and average price, to predict a given restaurant's Yelp score. The predicted Yelp score will be determined using feature vectors extracted from restaurant reviews, location, and price, provided in the data set.

### How to replicate
To run locally, install dependencies using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your python environment, then in project directory run the command `jupyter notebook` to launch the Jupyter notebook on localhost.
